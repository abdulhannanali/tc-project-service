# Topcoder Projects Service

Microservice to manage CRUD operations for all things Projects.

**Note : Steps mentioned below are best to our capability as guide for local deployment, however, we expect from contributor, being a developer, to resolve run-time issues (e.g. OS and node version issues etc), if any.**

## Local Development

Local setup should work good on **Linux** and **macOS**. But **Windows** is not supported at the moment.

### Requirements

* [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - We use docker-compose for running dependencies locally.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 12 - consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or equivalent to manage your node version
* Install [libpg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-native)

### Steps to run locally
1. Install node dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Local config

    1. In the `tc-project-service` root directory create `.env` file with the environment variables _(values should be shared with you on the forum)_:<br>
       ```
       AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=...
       AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=...
       AUTH0_URL=...
       AUTH0_AUDIENCE=...
       AUTH0_PROXY_SERVER_URL=...
       ```
       Values from this file would be automatically used by `docker-compose` and command `npm run start:dev` below.

    2. Copy config file `config/m2m.local.js` into `config/local.js`:
        ```bash
        cp config/m2m.local.js config/local.js
        ```

    3. Set `dockerhost` to point the IP address of Docker. Docker IP address depends on your system. For example if docker is run on IP `127.0.0.1` add a the next line to your `/etc/hosts` file:
       ```
       127.0.0.1       dockerhost
       ```

       Alternatively, you may update `config/local.js` and replace `dockerhost` with your docker IP address.

3. Start **ONE** of the docker-compose files with dependant services which are required for Project Service to work

   1. **Minimal** `./local/docker-compose.yml`:

      *Use this docker-compose if you only want to test and modify code of Project Service and you don't need Elasticsearch (ES) to work.*

      Run, in the project root folder:
      ```bash
      docker-compose -f local/docker-compose.yml up
      ```

      <details><summary>Click to see details</summary>
      <br>

      This docker-compose file starts the next services:
      |  Service | Name | Port  |
      |----------|:-----:|:----:|
      | PostgreSQL | db | 5432 |
      | Elasticsearch | esearch | 9200 |
      | RabbitMQ | queue | 5672, 15672  |
      | Mock Service (not in use) | jsonserver | 3001  |

      </details>

   2. **Full** `./local/full/docker-compose.yml`:

      *Use this docker-compose if you  want to test and modify code of Project Service together with one of the next relative services: [tc-bus-api](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api), [project-processor-es](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/project-processor-es), [tc-notifications](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-notifications) or you need Elasticsearch (ES) to work.*

      1. Run, in the project root folder:

          ```bash
          docker-compose -f local/full/docker-compose.yml up -d
          ```

      2. Wait until all containers are fully started. As a good indicator, wait until `project-processor-es` successfully started by viewing its logs:

         ```bash
         docker-compose -f local/full/docker-compose.yml logs -f project-processor-es
         ```

        <details><summary>Click to see example logs</summary>
        <br>

         - first it would be waiting for `kafka-client` to create all the required topics and exit, you would see:

           ```
           project-processor-es_1        | Waiting for kafka-client to exit....
           ```

        - after that, `project-processor-es` would be started itself. Make sure it successfully connected to Kafka, you should see 3 lines with text `Subscribed to project.action.`:

          ```
          project-processor-es_1        | 2020-02-19T03:18:46.523Z DEBUG no-kafka-client Subscribed to project.action.update:0 offset 0 leader kafka:9093
          project-processor-es_1        | 2020-02-19T03:18:46.524Z DEBUG no-kafka-client Subscribed to project.action.delete:0 offset 0 leader kafka:9093
          project-processor-es_1        | 2020-02-19T03:18:46.528Z DEBUG no-kafka-client Subscribed to project.action.create:0 offset 0 leader kafka:9093
          ```
        </details>

      3. If you want to modify the code of any of the services which are run inside this docker-compose file, you can stop such service inside docker-compose by command `docker-compose -f local/full/docker-compose.yml stop -f <SERVICE_NAME>` and run the service separately, following its README file.

      <details><summary>Click to see details</summary>
      <br>

      This docker-compose file starts the next services:
      |  Service | Name | Port  |
      |----------|:-----:|:----:|
      | PostgreSQL | db | 5432 |
      | Elasticsearch | esearch | 9200 |
      | RabbitMQ | queue | 5672, 15672  |
      | Mock Service (not in use) | jsonserver | 3001  |
      | Zookeeper | zookeeper | 2181  |
      | Kafka | kafka | 9092  |
      | [tc-bus-api](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api) | tc-bus-api | 8002  |
      | [project-processor-es](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/project-processor-es) | project-processor-es | 5000  |
      | [tc-notifications-api](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-notifications) | tc-notifications-api | 4000  |
      | [tc-notifications-processor](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-notifications) | tc-notifications-processor | 4001  |

      - as many of the Topcoder services which are run in this docker-compose require Auth0 configuration for M2M calls, that's why if we want to start this docker-compose file, we have to set environment variables `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_URL`, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`, `AUTH0_PROXY_SERVER_URL` first and they would be passed inside containers.

      - `docker-compose` automatically would create Kafka topics which are used by `tc-project-service` listed in `local/full/kafka-client/topics.txt`.

      - To view the logs from any container inside docker-compose use the following command, replacing `SERVICE_NAME` with the corresponding value under the **Name** column in the above table:

        ```bash
        docker-compose -f local/full/docker-compose.yml logs -f SERVICE_NAME
        ```

      </details>

   *NOTE: In production these dependencies / services are hosted & managed outside Project Service.*

4. Create tables in DB
    ```bash
    NODE_ENV=development npm run sync:db
    ```

    *NOTE: this will drop tables if they already exist.*

5. Create ES (Elasticsearch) indexes
    ```bash
    NODE_ENV=development npm run sync:es
    ```

    *NOTE: This will first clear all the indices and than recreate them. So use with caution.*

6. Start Project Service

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

   Runs the Project Service using nodemon, so it would be restarted after any of the files is updated.
   The project service will be served on `http://localhost:8001`.

7. *(Optional)* Start Project Service Kafka Consumer

   *Run this only if you want to test or modify logic of `lastActivityAt` or `lastActivityBy`.*

   In another terminal window run:

   ```bash
   npm run startKafkaConsumers:dev
   ```

### Import sample metadata projects

```bash
CONNECT_USER_TOKEN=<connect user token> npm run demo-data
```
To retrieve data from DEV env we have to provide a valid user token (`CONNECT_USER_TOKEN`). You may login to http://connect.topcoder-dev.com and find the Bearer token in the request headers using browser dev tools.

This command for importing data uses API to create demo data. Which has a few pecularities:
- data in DB would be for sure created
- data in ElasticSearch Index (ES) would be only created if services [project-processor-es](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/project-processor-es) and [tc-bus-api](https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api) are also started locally. If you don't start them, then imported data wouldn't be indexed in ES, and would be only added to DB. You may start them locally separately, or better use `local/full/docker-compose.yml` as described [next section](#local-deployment-with-other-topcoder-services) which would start them automatically.
   - **NOTE** During data importing a lot of records has to be indexed in ES, so you have to wait about 5-10 minutes after `npm run demo-data` is finished until imported data is indexed in ES. You may watch logs of `project-processor-es` to see if its done or no.

### Run Connect App with Project Service locally

To be able to run [Connect App](https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app) with the local setup of Project Service we have to do two things:
1. Configurate Connect App to use locally deployed Project service inside `connect-app/config/constants/dev.js` set

   ```js
   PROJECTS_API_URL: 'http://localhost:8001'
   TC_NOTIFICATION_URL: 'http://localhost:4000/v5/notifications' # if tc-notfication-api has been locally deployed
   ```

2. Bypass token validation in Project Service.

   In `tc-project-service/node_modules/tc-core-library-js/lib/auth/verifier.js` add this to line 23:
   ```js
   callback(undefined, decodedToken.payload);
   return;
   ```
   Connect App when making requests to the Project Service uses token retrieved from the Topcoder service deployed online. Project Service validates the token. For this purpose Project Service have to know the `secret` which has been used to generate the token. But we don't know the `secret` which is used by Topcoder for both DEV and PROD environment. So to bypass token validation we change these lines in the auth library.

   *NOTE: this change only let us bypass validation during local development process*.

3. Restart both Connect App and Project Service if they were running.

## Test
```bash
npm run test
```
Tests are being executed with the `NODE_ENV` environment variable has a value `test` and `config/test.js` configuration is loaded.

Each of the individual modules/services are unit tested.

### JWT Authentication
Authentication is handled via Authorization (Bearer) token header field. Token is a JWT token. Here is a sample token that is valid for a very long time for a user with administrator role.
```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyb2xlcyI6WyJhZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9yIl0sImlzcyI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLnRvcGNvZGVyLWRldi5jb20iLCJoYW5kbGUiOiJwc2hhaDEiLCJleHAiOjI0NjI0OTQ2MTgsInVzZXJJZCI6IjQwMTM1OTc4IiwiaWF0IjoxNDYyNDk0MDE4LCJlbWFpbCI6InBzaGFoMUB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsImp0aSI6ImY0ZTFhNTE0LTg5ODAtNDY0MC04ZWM1LWUzNmUzMWE3ZTg0OSJ9.XuNN7tpMOXvBG1QwWRQROj7NfuUbqhkjwn39Vy4tR5I
```
It's been signed with the secret 'secret'. This secret should match your entry in config/local.js. You can generate your own token using https://jwt.io

## Deploying with docker (might need updates)

**NOTE: This part of README may contain inconsistencies and requires update. Don't follow it unless you know how to properly make configuration for these steps. It's not needed for regular development process.**

Build image:
`docker build -t tc_projects_services .`
Run image:
`docker run -p 3000:3000 -i -t -e DB_HOST=172.17.0.1 tc_projects_services`
You may replace 172.17.0.1 with your docker0 IP.

You can paste **swagger.yaml** to  [swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) or import **postman.json** and **postman_environment.json** to verify endpoints.

## Kafka commands

If you've used **Full** `docker-compose` with the file `local/full/docker-compose.yml` during local setup to spawn kafka & zookeeper, you can use the following commands to manipulate kafka topics and messages:
(Replace `TOPIC_NAME` with the name of the desired topic)

### Create Topic

```bash
docker exec tc-projects-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper zookeeper:2181 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --topic TOPIC_NAME
```

### List Topics

```bash
docker exec tc-projects-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper zookeeper:2181
```

### Watch Topic

```bash
docker exec  tc-projects-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic TOPIC_NAME
```

### Post Message to Topic (from stdin)

```bash
docker exec -it tc-projects-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic TOPIC_NAME
```

- Enter or copy/paste the message into the console after starting this command.
